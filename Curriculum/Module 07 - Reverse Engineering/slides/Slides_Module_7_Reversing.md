# **Reverse Engineering 101**

As I like to call it:

![bg right 80%](./figures/intro.png)

---

# **Assembly Recap**

CPUs work with registers and memory
x86-64 has many registers such as ` rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, rsp, rip, r8-r15`

Special registers:
`rip`: Current instruction pointer
`rsp`: Current stack pointer
`rbp`: Stack frame base pointer
`cr3`: Virtual memory selector for a process

---

# **Assembly Recap**

We can access certain bits of registers individually:

![width:1200](./figures/multi-access-register.png)
[1]

This allows for backwards compatability
32-bit programs can just use `eax`

---

# **Assembly Recap**

Instruction format:
`<instruction_mnemonic>  <destination>, <source>`
`mov    rax,            rbx`
-> Means move rbx to rax
-> The compiler turns assembly into actual opcodes
`mov    rax,            rbx` => 0x48, 0x89, 0xd8

---

# **Assembly Recap**

## **Data Movement**

`mov rax, rbx` Moves rbx into rax
`mov rax, 0x4000` Moves 0x4000 into rax
`mov rax, [rbx]` Moves the 8-byte value at the address of rbx into rax
=> rbx = 0x400000 `mov rax, [0x400000]`
=> `rax = *0x400000;`

---

# **Assembly Recap**

## **Arithmetics**

`add rax, rbx` Adds rbx to rax
`sub rax, rbx` Substracts rbx from rax
`xor rax, rbx` ...
`and rax, rbx` ...
...

---

# **Assembly Recap**

## **Control Flow**

`call function` Calls a function
`ret` Returns from a function to the next instruction
Example:
`call target`
=> `mov rax, 3`
=> `ret`
`mov rbx, rax` \<=
rbx = 3

---

# **Assembly Recap**

## **Control Flow**

`jmp address` Always jump to address

`jnz address` Jump if not zero
`je address` Jump if equal
`jle address` Jump if less or equal
=> Based on EFLAGS (special registers)

---

# **Assembly Recap**

## **Control Flow**

```
cmp rax, rbx
jle error
ret
```

Jump to error IF RAX \<= RBX
Otherwise return from the function

---

# **C to assembly**

int x;
x = 10;
`mov rax, 10`

Not every C line is atomic in asm:

x = x + 10;

```
mov rbx, rax // temporary value
add rbx, 10  // add 10
mov rax, rbx // move temp back to x
```

# **Rev 101**

- Analysis of a system, program or (obfuscated) source code

  - Often binary analysis

- Find out what itâ€™s doing

  - Revertible, Exploitable?

---

# **Real world usage**

- Malware research

- Bug hunting in consumer software & operating systems

- Modding games

  - Cracking

- Debugging
  ![bg right fit](./figures/keygen.png)

---

# **Executables**

- ELF
  - Executable and Linking Format (UNIX)
- PE
  - Portable Executable (WINDOWS)
- Tells our OS how to load and execute it
- Contains Imports (Libraries), Exports, Sections, Entrypoint

---

# **Tools for executables**

- UNIX:
  - file: Tries to determine the filetype
  - strings: Print all ascii strings in the file
  - hexdump: See raw bytes of the file
  - readelf: Parses the elf file and prints info
  - objdump: ELF infos & disassembly
- Windows:
  - CFF Explorer/ Explorer Suite by NTCore

---

# **Concepts**

- Type of with the binary
  - Static
  - Dynamic
- Emulation/Tracing
- Diffing
- Patching
- Sidechannels
- Symbolic execution

---

# **Static analysis**

- "Offline" analysis

  - Binary is not executed

- Disassembler

  - Turns opcodes into asm instructions
  - `68 6e 2f 73 68` => `push 0x68732f6e`

- Decompiler

  - Turn asm instructions into somewhat readable code

---

# **Static tools**

- Native binaries:
  - Ghidra (Free, works well on most arches + languages)
    - Gui sucks => Cutter Plugin
  - IDA: Gold standard for x86, okayish on other arches
  - BinaryNinja: Mix of IDA and Ghidra
    - Especially good for newer languages such as Go and Rust

---

# **Static tools cont.**

- Python:
  - Pyinstxtractor
    - Extract bundled python files
  - Pycdc
    - Disassemble/Decompile python bytecode

---

# **Static tools cont.**

- Android APKs
  - Essentially Java
  - Jadx: GUI for apktool essentially
  - apktool: CLI to decompile/compile apks
  - github/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer: Automatically sign apks

---

# **Static tools cont.**

- .NET
  - DotPeek: Disassembler/Decompiler for .NET
  - ILSpy: Same as above
  - github/Droppers/SingleFileExtractor: Extract .NET from native libraries

---

# **Dynamic analysis**

- Run/emulate the binary and attach a debugger/tracer
- Breakpoints
  - Addresses in memory where execution shall be paused
    - PAUSE = rip == TARGET
  - Prints infos about current registers/memory
  - Static analysis to find breakpoints
- Single stepping / tracing
  - One instruction at a time, print infos

---

# **Dynamic tools**

- Native:
  - strace/ltrace: Traces syscalls/library calls
  - GDB
    - pwndbg, gef
  - Emulators
    - QEMU
    - qiling
  - Inbuilt debuggers of decompilers
    - Supports breaking in pseudocode

---

# **Dynamic tools cont.**

- Android APKs:

  - Android Studio for emulation
  - FRIDA

- .NET

  - JetBrains RIDER
    - Supports binary debugging
    - Disassembles automatically

---

# **"Just run it lmao" - analysis**

- Running unknown executables

  - **Bad idea**

- Even dockerfiles can be malicious

  - Insomnihack 23 (https://cryptax.github.io/2023/03/25/shame.html)

- Always emulate unknown binaries or use a VM

---

# **"Just run it lmao" - done right**

- Emulation

  - Works cross OS

- Full system emulation

  - Qiling, QEMU System/Usermode

- Instruction emulation

  - **No syscall support**
  - e.g. Unicorn Engine
  - Lots of manual work

---

# **Diffing**

- Prerequisite: Static analysis
- Needs 2+ program databases (e.g. from IDA)
- BinDiff databases
  - Find matching functions/patterns
  - See newly added functions

---

![bg contain](./figures/bindiff.png)
[2]

---

# **Patching**

- Modify instructions to get different behaviour
  - e.g. `jnz address` => `jz address`
- Remove instructions by using NOPs
  - `mov eax, ebx` => `nop nop`
- Used to bypass checks or security
- What happens if we leak some infos by doing this?

---

# **Sidechannels**

- Leak infos
- Bruteforce inputs much faster e.g 26\*6 instead of 26\*\*6
- Timing attacks
  or
- CPU metric attacks
  - perf-tools on Linux

---

# **Symbolic execution**

- Execute a program
- Find all paths and values that satisfy each branching condition
- Output inputs that satisfy certain branches

---

Given this function, how many paths are there?

```
int get_sign(int x) {
  if (x == 0)
    return 0;

  if (x < 0)
    return -1;
  else
    return 1;
}
```

---

Three branching conditions, which inputs satisfy each path?

```
int get_sign(int x) {
  if (x == 0)
    ...
  if (x < 0)
  ...
  if (x > 0)
  ...
}
```

---

# **Symbolic execution tools**

- angr
  - Black box (works on binary level)
- klee
  - White box (requires source code)
- manticore (unmaintained)
  - Like angr black box, requires more fine tuning

---

# **How2Start**

1. Run strings and gather infos about the binary
1. What's the goal?
   - Want a key/input?
   - Optimization problem?
1. Optional: Can we cheese it?
   - Sidechannels? Do we have an oracle?
   - Symbolic execution
   - Patching or info leaks?

---

# **How2Start cont.**

4. *Actually* reverse the binary and figure out the *actual* solution
1. ???
1. Validate solution

---

# **Live demo - cracking**
