# Cryptography

In this module, we will explore the fascinating world of cryptography. Students will learn about different encryption techniques, hashing, digital signatures, and public key infrastructure (PKI). We will also discuss common cryptographic attacks and how to defend against them.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the fundamental concepts of cryptography, including encryption, decryption, and hashing
- Analyze different encryption algorithms and their use cases
- Evaluate digital signatures and public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Identify and defend against common cryptographic attacks

## Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Cryptography
2. Symmetric Key Cryptography
    - Stream Ciphers
    - Block Ciphers
3. Asymmetric Key Cryptography
    - Public Key Cryptography
    - Digital Signatures
    - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
4. Cryptographic Attacks
    - Brute Force Attacks
    - Dictionary Attacks
    - Rainbow Tables
    - Side-Channel Attacks

By the end of this module, students should have a strong understanding of cryptography and its applications in IT security.
