# Module 15: Binary Exploitation

In this module, students will learn about binary exploitation techniques and vulnerabilities in software that can be exploited to take control of a system. The module will cover various techniques for identifying, exploiting, and defending against common vulnerabilities in binary programs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic principles of binary exploitation
- Identify common vulnerabilities in binary programs
- Use tools such as gdb and pwntools to analyze and exploit binary vulnerabilities
- Implement basic defenses against common binary exploits

## Topics Covered

1. Introduction to Binary Exploitation
2. Basic Stack Overflows
3. Return Oriented Programming (ROP)
4. Format String Vulnerabilities
5. Heap Exploitation
6. Defending Against Binary Exploits

By the end of this module, students should have a basic understanding of binary exploitation techniques and the ability to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities in binary programs. They should also be able to implement basic defenses
