2. **Platform Security:**
   - *CSP Responsibility:* Manage and secure the underlying cloud infrastructure, including hypervisors and host operating systems.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Secure and update operating systems, middleware, and runtime environments within their virtual machines or containers.

3. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
   - *CSP Responsibility:* Provide tools for identity management, authentication, and access control.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Manage user access, permissions, and authentication processes for applications and data.

4. **Data Security:**
   - *CSP Responsibility:* Ensure security and durability of underlying storage infrastructure.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Encrypt sensitive data, set access controls, and manage data retention policies.

5. **Applications and Endpoints:**
   - *CSP Responsibility:* Offer a secure platform for hosting applications and may provide security features.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Develop, secure, and monitor applications, as well as ensure endpoint security.

6. **Security Monitoring and Incident Response:**
   - *CSP Responsibility:* Monitor overall infrastructure health and security, provide tools for incident detection.
   - *Customer Responsibility:* Monitor applications, data, and user activities, and respond to security incidents related to their resources.

#### Best Practices:
