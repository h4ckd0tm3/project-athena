- **Roles**: Predefined sets of permissions that determine what actions are allowed on resources.

    - **Custom Roles**: Customized sets of permissions.

- **Policies**: Define who (identity) has what access (role) for resources.

- **Members**: Users, groups (multiple users), domains (projects belong to a domain), or service accounts (accounts for programs to automate tasks or to represent services).

### 1.2. **Cloud Identity**

- Provides identity services like user enrollment, account recovery, and multi-factor authentication.
