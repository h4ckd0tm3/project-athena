# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

## **Introduction**

- SIEM combines **security information management (SIM)** and **security event management (SEM)**
- **aggregating** and **analyzing** event data from various sources like applications, endpoints, firewalls, and networks.
- assists in quick identification of cyber threats through real-time threat monitoring and alerting capabilities.

**Data Correlation and Analysis**

- **Reactive Nature**: Traditional SIEM systems focused on reactive logging and event management.
- **Proactive Shift**: Recent trends show a shift towards more proactive measures, integrating new threat data for better issue identification.
- **AI Integration**: Adoption of AI tools in SIEM systems helps narrow alert windows and automate security responses, moving from reactive to proactive responses.

**Event Log Management**

- **Essential Component**: Involves collection, normalization, and analysis of log data for network visibility and detecting security incidents.
- **Evolution and Challenges**: Modern SIEM solutions are evolving to address dynamic cybersecurity challenges, with an emphasis on cloud-based solutions for flexibility.
- **Combining with SOAR**: Integration with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) tools extends the usability of SIEM tools, though they remain fundamentally reactive.

**Monitoring and Alerting**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: SIEM is crucial for real-time monitoring and alerting in cloud and on-premise infrastructures.
- **Automation and AI**: Increasing use of AI and automation in SIEM and SOAR tools to save time and improve efficiency in threat response.
- **Cloud Migration**: There is a growing trend to move SIEM and SOAR solutions to the cloud to support scalable resources and enhance automation capabilities.

## **Key Capabilities**

- **Threat Analytics**
  - SIEM systems are evolving to address complex security threats, although they primarily focus on logging and event management
- **Cloud Security**
  - The advancement of cloud-based SIEM solutions since 2020 reflects the need for fast, flexible, and customizable security solutions
- **Integrated Compliance**
  - assists in regulatory compliance by continuously collecting and reporting network data in real-time
- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**
  - The integration of new threat data in SIEM systems aids in detecting potential phishing efforts and identifying compromise points, aligning with the user behavior analytics approach.
- **Alerting**
- **Incident Response**
  - Combining SIEM with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) extends the usability of these tools. However, even this combination is reactive rather than proactive, indicating a need for solutions that fill these gaps, such as extended detection and response (XDR).

- Requirement of integration with other solutions
- Extensive oversight and control needed from security experts
- Initial and ongoing costs
- Difficulty in differentiating between regular activities and incidents.
