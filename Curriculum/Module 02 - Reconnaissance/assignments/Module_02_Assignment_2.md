## Assignment 2: Enumerating and Analyzing a Server

### Objective:

This assignment focuses on server enumeration, a critical part of the reconnaissance phase in cybersecurity. You will use various tools to identify and document the services running on a target server. For the bonus task, you will go further to identify a vulnerability, exploit it, and document your process in detail.

### Instructions:

#### 1. **Server Enumeration:**

- Connect to the provided target server using the network configuration details shared with you.
- Use **Nmap** and other relevant enumeration tools to scan the server. Your primary goal is to identify:
  - Open ports.
  - Running services and their versions.
  - Potential entry points based on the services found.
- Document the enumeration process in detail, including the commands used, the output of your scans, and any notable observations.
- Create a table summarizing all the discovered services, their versions, and the associated ports.

#### 2. **Analysis:**

- Based on the enumeration results, provide a brief analysis of each discovered service, discussing:
  - The potential risks associated with each service.
  - Any suspicious or unusual services that could indicate security weaknesses.
- Include references to publicly available documentation or databases (e.g., CVE, NIST) that highlight vulnerabilities commonly associated with the discovered services.

#### 3. **Report Writing:**

- Compile your findings into a well-structured report that includes:
  - An introduction to the server enumeration task.
  - A detailed description of the enumeration process.
  - A summary table of the discovered services and their versions.
  - Your analysis of the services and potential vulnerabilities.
- Ensure the report is clear, concise, and uses professional language.
- Include a conclusion summarizing the key findings of your enumeration.

### Submission Guidelines:

1. **Report:**
   - Submit your report as a PDF document.
   - The cover page should include your name, date, and the title of the report.
   - Organize your report with sections: introduction, enumeration process, discovered services, analysis, and conclusion.

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Enumeration:**
   - Completeness of the enumeration process.
   - Correct use of tools like Nmap for identifying open ports and services.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Clear presentation of the enumeration results.
   - Quality and accuracy of the analysis for each discovered service.

3. **Report Quality:**
   - Organization and clarity of the report.
   - Depth of analysis and insight into potential vulnerabilities.

### Bonus Points: Finding and Exploiting a Vulnerability

#### Objective:
Gain bonus points by identifying a vulnerability on the server, exploiting it, and documenting the entire process.

#### Instructions:

1. **Vulnerability Identification:**
   - Use **Nmap** scripts (e.g., `nmap --script vuln`) or other vulnerability scanning tools to identify a potential vulnerability in one of the enumerated services.
   - Document the commands used and the results indicating the presence of a vulnerability.

2. **Exploit the Vulnerability:**
   - Research and identify a suitable exploit for the discovered vulnerability. You can use tools such as **Metasploit** or standalone scripts.
   - Execute the exploit and, if successful, access the `/flag` file on the target server.
   - Document the exploitation process, including:
     - How you identified the vulnerability.
     - The steps taken to exploit it.
     - The commands and tools used to gain access.

3. **Document the Bonus Task:**
   - Add a separate section in your report titled "Bonus Points Task: Vulnerability Exploitation."
   - Include screenshots or logs that demonstrate the exploitation process and the retrieval of the `/flag` file.
   - Explain how the vulnerability could be mitigated or prevented.

### Additional Submission Guidelines for Bonus Points:

- Include the bonus task in your report as a distinct section.
- Clearly label this section as "Bonus Points Task: Vulnerability Exploitation" for ease of evaluation.

### Evaluation Criteria for Bonus Points:

1. **Vulnerability Identification:**
   - Effectiveness in using Nmap or other tools to find a server vulnerability.

2. **Exploitation Process:**
   - Clarity and detail in documenting the exploitation steps.
   - Successful retrieval of the `/flag` file.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Clear explanation of how the vulnerability was identified, exploited, and how it could be mitigated.

By completing this assignment, you will improve your understanding of server enumeration and vulnerability exploitation, key aspects of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
