# GTFO Bins

## What is that?

GTFO Bins is a website that gives one options and commands that one can execute in the terminal, depending on which binary one has access on a Linux machine to give one access to a higher privileged user.

## How does the website work?

The website greets the user with a searchbar that can be used to search for a binary.

Upon clicking on a option the website will show a list of commands and their functions.

The website also offers the option to filter for certain functions, so that only binaries with those are displayed.
